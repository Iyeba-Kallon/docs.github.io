# Pull Requests

Pull Requests (PRs) are the main mechanism for reviewing code and collaboration.

## Best Practices
- Keep PRs **small and focused**. Large PRs are hard to review.
- Write **clear titles and descriptions** explaining the purpose and context.
- Include relevant links to tasks, issues, or references.
- Mark work-in-progress PRs with `[WIP]`.
- @mention individuals or teams for specific feedback or discussion.

### Benefits
- Easier code reviews
- Better collaboration
- Maintains a history of decisions
- Serves as documentation for changes

**Tips for Writing PRs**
- State the **problem being solved**.
- Explain **why the change is needed**.
- Ask explicitly for **feedback type** (code review, design critique, etc.).
- Avoid assuming prior knowledge of the issue.
- Use clear and professional language.
