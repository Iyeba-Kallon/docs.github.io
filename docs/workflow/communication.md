# Communication Guidelines

Effective communication ensures smooth workflow and clear expectations.

## Meetings & Updates
- **Standups:** Quick updates on daily or weekly tasks.
- **End-of-cycle meetings:** Planning and retrospective discussions.
- **Heartbeats:** Summaries of work completed during the cycle.
- **Kickoffs:** Plans for the upcoming development cycle.

## Synchronous vs Asynchronous
- **Synchronous:** Urgent/high-priority tasks; use calls, hangouts, or screen sharing.
- **Asynchronous:** Non-urgent tasks; use posts, emails, Slack messages. Allows focus and avoids constant interruptions.

## Reporting
- Answer twice a week: “What did you work on today?”
- Answer weekly: “What will you work on this week?”
- End-of-cycle: Heartbeats and Kickoffs.

## Mentorship & Onboarding
- **Interns:** Must have a mentor/DRI and a work plan. 1-on-1s at least every two weeks.
- **New Devs:** Walk through workflow docs, added to GitHub, Slack, email, team, and assigned a mentor.

## Management Style
- **Managers of one:** Developers should know how to self-organize and take initiative when direction isn’t explicit.
- Encourage initiative, improvements, and independent problem-solving.
